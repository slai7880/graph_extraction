This file contains most of the core functions being used in the project.

The first step before using this program is to crop an example of the vertices,
and then pass the template to the function process_template so that we can get
a new version where only the edges remain together with some helpful values
which will be used in later procedures.

To begin the user needs to call the function locate_vertices with an approaximate
number of vertices, a copy of the gray-scale image, the template and its size
values obtained in the previous step, and a list of nodes(this can be empty).
The function implements the multi-scale template matching technique, that is,
the function rescales the image, for each scale, it finds a piece of the image
which matches the template the most by calling a function matchTemplate from
the OpenCV package and store the upper-left coordinate of that piece into the
provided list nodes. In order to prevent the function from finding the same
piece of the image, everytime a piece is found, a white block is placed right
on its location so that the piece will be covered up. Note that this is done on
a copy of the image so that the original one will not be damaged. This function
may need to be called multiple times in order to find all the vertices. If
there is still one or more vertices remaining on the image undetected after a
few times then the image cannot be handled by this program. Otherwise, when all
the vertices are found the user must examine the node list, indicate the
indices of false vertices, and use the function remove_indices to get rid of
them. Be careful about the impact of the BASE value. Lastly the user may also
want to call teh function get_center_pos to obtain the center coordinates of
the true vertices. Once this step is finalized, a list of vertices can be
obtained. Moreover for the rest of the program whenever we need to deal with
a full list of elements that are all related to the vertices(the center
coordinate of each vertex for example), the elements in the new list must be in
the same order as in the nodes and the nodes_center. In other words we have
assigned each vertex an ID number implicitly.

Next we want to find the edges. There are two main steps involved. Firstly we
want to get rid of the noise on the image as much as possible. A commonly used
approach is mathematical morphology. In this file the denoise function can help
to do the job. When the image is in a desired stage after the noise reduction,
the function thin needs to be called such that the skeleton of the content can
be extracted. And then the user may want to hide the vertices and make sure
that the result is also in a desired view(no extra overlaps between edges for
example). Note that after this step a binary version of the image should be
obtained and we will use it throughout the rest of the program. We can now
start attempting to extract the edges.

From now on assume that in the binary image the content is represented by 1s
and the background is marked by 0s. The first thint to do is to find all the
starting points of the edges. With the vertices hidden, it is easy to scan all
the content pixels and find the ones with the smallest distances to some
located vertex. The output of this step should be a list of sets of pixels
where the ith set in the list should contain the coordinates of the pixels that
are at the end of the edges connecting to the ith vertex. Next we need to
extract the edges. For each starting point, the algorithm to determine which
vertex is the corresponding edge linked to can be described as follows:

1. Check if the current position has already reached a vertex that is not the
   starting one. If so then we are done and return, otherwise go to step 2.
2. Obtain a neighborhood of the current potition, examine the neighborhood and
   extract a list of pixels that are marked 1 and are not in the known list.
   Add them into the known list. If the length of the list is 0 then go to step
   3. Otherwise go to step 4.
3. Abort since this is the end of a line and there is no vertex to link to.
4. If the length of the list trail is 0 then for each candidate pixel
   go back to step 1. Otherwise, if the length is 1 and if the current position
   is not in the conjunction of two edges then append the current position to
   the trail list, if not in the conjunction then take the only candidate back
   to the first step. If there are more than one candidate, then determine if
   the current position is a cross point. If so then check if it is also in a
   conjunction part. If not append the current position to the trail list. If
   this is not a cross then the current position also needs to be added to the
   trail list. Proceed to step 5.
5. Using the trail list, construct a list of vectors between each pair of
   adjacent points in the trail, then compute a weighted sum of these vectors.
   For each candidate compute a vector that points to them from the current
   position. Compare each candidate vector and the sum vector, choose the one
   with the smallest angle with the sum vector and take that corresponding
   candidate pixel to step 1. If the returned result is not a valid vertex then
   choose the 2nd closest vector and its corresponding destination position.
   Repeat until a valid result is obtained or the options are run out.

The way in which a cross is detected is simple: for each candidate pixel
compute a vector that points from the current position to it and for each pair
of these candidate vectors check if their angle is greater than or equal to 90
degree. The idea behind the approach to decide which direction to go next at a
cross point is to make the decision based on a weighted sum of the previous
experience and the previous experience does not include any conjunction part.
Currently what is problematic is the weighting function applied on the vectors.
For now I have not yet found a really "good" funtion to use as much as I do
believe that my approach is reasonable.
